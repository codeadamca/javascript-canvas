    <h1>Sizing the Canvas</h1>
    
    <p>When including a canvas into an HTML document you need to consider two sets 
        of widths and heights. First, there is the width and height that was 
        determined when saving the image from Photoshop or Illustrator. Second, you
        determine the size the image will appear using styles.</p>
    
    <p>Likewise with a canvas, you have two sets of dimensions. First, are the 
        width and height set in the canvas tag (or with JavaScript), these are like
        the dimensions set in Photoshop. Second, you have the dimensions set in your styles, the actual visual size of the canvas.</p>
    
    <p>Just like an image, do not set your canvas to 200 by 200 pixels and
        then display it 600 by 600 pixels, or it will appear blurry.</p>
    
    <canvas width="20" height="20" id="canvas"></canvas>
    
    <script>
    
        /*
        This is an example of a small canvas being stretched, notice 
        how blurry the line appears. 
        */
        var canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
        
        /*
        These two lines can be used to change the dimesions of the canvas 
        to match the visual dimensions of the canvs, so nothing is stretehced. 
        Uncomment these lines to see a better looking line. 
        */
        // canvas.width = window.innerWidth;
        // canvas.height = window.innerHeight;
        
        var context = canvas.getContext("2d");
        context.moveTo(0, 0);
        context.lineTo(600, 600);
        context.stroke();
